1) Implement stack operation using OpenGL.
stack will look like a ladder, with some fixed size.
initially STACK EMPTY message must be displayed on output window.
text must be added to output window, showing press Key 'I" to perform push operation and key 'D' for pop operation.
respective message must be displayed for push and pop operation, overwriting previous message.
push operation will randomly add some integer value to stack.
if stack is full, STACK EMPTY message must be displayed.
2) Modifications on above problem statement will be asked
